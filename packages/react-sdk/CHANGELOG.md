## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- d1aa5b7: Migrate neoboard to vitejs + vitest

  We replaced react-scripts with vitejs and jest with vitest. This change should not affect the functionality of the widget,
  but it allows us to update dependencies and modernize the build process. It also improves the ability to react to security issues in the future.

  However there are changes to the tooling. This will only affect you if you are building the widget yourself and do not use the provided build script.
  This means that you will need to update your build script to use vitejs instead of react-scripts. Additionally, if you had custom changes to the configurations you will have to update them to the vitejs equivalent.

  Finally, the package is now an ECMAScript module (ESM). This means that you might have to update your imports if you consumed the package directly.

### Minor Changes

- c068495: The font size can now be set absolutely. Automatic font sizes are still available.
- 4153d8d: Enhanced the Developer Tools by moving them into a more user-friendly and accessible dialog, improving usability.
- fd631c6: Transparent is now the last colour in the picker, so that the order of colours is the same for shapes and other elements.
- 9eed0b8: New API functions: WhiteboardManager.clear, WhiteboardInstance.persist and WhiteboardInstance.destroy
- 95dc0a4: Adds PDF import as images in slides
- 35d0fee: Ensure that we calculate the mime types ourself due to browsers only checking the file ending and the data on import being untrsuted user input.

  This allows that SVGs are properly working inside of pdf exports and images handling is more stable.

- 60c3602: The grid size changed from 40 to 20 px
- 14f9a15: NeoBoard now monitors the browser's online state and displays a notification if offline
